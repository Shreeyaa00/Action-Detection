# Action-Detection from Surveillance Video

This project is a lightweight Python-based application that detects people and classifies their actions from surveillance videos. It uses **YOLOv8** for person detection and a simple placeholder logic for action classification. Ideal for beginners who want to experiment with real-time computer vision pipelines in Python!

**Features:**
1. Detects people using YOLOV8
2. Classifies detected actions
3. Saves annotated video with bounding boxes and action labels
4. works with any CCTV-style video footage
5. modular code structure, ready for upgrades


**Tech Stack**
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. Ultralytics YOLOV8
4. VSCode
